\title{Calculates TASSE terrain attributes with various window sizes}
\usage{
TASSE_AWA(bathy, window_size = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, opt = c(1, 2),
  return_aspect = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bathy}{bathymetry (or dem) raster}

\item{na.rm}{whether to remove na's (default is FALSE)}

\item{return_aspect}{logical indicating whether to return aspect (default is FALSE)}
}
\description{
Calculates TASSE terrain attributes using an nxn window including relative deviation from mean value (rdmv), aspect, eastness, norhtnessm slope, standard deviation, and local mean. Depth is assumed to be negative values in calculation. By default if any values within window are NA, calculated value is NA. Slope and aspect are returned in degrees.
