\usage{
reproject_align_raster(
  rast,
  ref_rast = NULL,
  desired_origin,
  desired_res,
  desired_crs,
  method = "bilinear"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rast}{raster to be reprojected or resampled}

\item{ref_rast}{reference raster with desired properties (Alternatively can supply desired_origin, desired_res, and desired_crs)}

\item{desired_origin}{desired origin of output raster as a vector with length 2 (x,y)}

\item{desired_res}{desired resolution of output raster. Either an integer or a vector of length 2 (x,y)}

\item{desired_crs}{desired coordinate reference system of output raster (CRS class)}

\item{method}{resampling method. Either "bilinear" for bilinear interpolation (the default), or "ngb" for using the nearest neighbor}
}
\description{
Reprojects/resamples and aligns a raster by matching a raster a raster to a specified origin, resolution, and coordinate reference system, or that of a reference raster. Useful for preparing adjacent areas before using raster::merge.
