\usage{
generate_cruise_files(output_dir, EK_dir, CBASS_dir, Ship_dir, winch_dir,
  altimeter_file = "altimeter_readings.tsv",
  ctd_file = "ctd_readings.tsv", compass_file = "compass_readings.tsv",

}
\arguments{
\item{output_dir}{Directory to output files to}

\item{EK_dir}{Directory of Ek Ship track file(s). Shiptrack files must be the only files in that directory that end in ".gps.csv"}

\item{CBASS_dir}{Directory of CBASS transects}

\item{Ship_dir}{Directory containing "Northstar-941X---GPVTG" file(s) (.lab or .Raw)}

\item{winch_dir}{Directory of winch data or path to Alex #2's payout tsv files}

\item{altimeter_file}{name of altimeter files in CBASS directory. Default is "altimeter_readings.tsv" (only change if there is a default in original data table)}

\item{ctd_file}{name of ctd files under CBASS directory. Default is "ctd_readings.tsv" (only change if there is a mistake in default data table)}

\item{compass_file}{name of compass files under CBASS directory. Default is "compass_readings.tsv" (only change if there is a mistake in original default table)}

\item{CBASS_transect_name}{Name of CBASS transect. Only use if you want to generate files for just one transect.}

\item{CBASS_transect_subdir}{Name of sub_dir for CBASS transect. Only use if you want to generate files for just one transect.}
}
\description{
Generates 1Hz tables for all transects within a cruise (Ship Speed, Ship position, CBASS layback, CBASS depth, CBASS altitude, CBASS Pitch, CBASS Position) as well as diagnostic plots. Can also be used to generate this for a specific transect rather than full cruise using "CBASS_transect_name" and "CBASS_transect_subdir" arguments. Will also output a file "messages.txt" that logs inputs/warnings/errors. Note: If there is an error and you cannot delete "messages.txt" you may need to run "closeAllConnections()"
